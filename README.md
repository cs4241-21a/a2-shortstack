## Book Keeper App

https://a2-mcaten-maddison-caten.glitch.me

My book keeper application keeps track of the books that a person has read. I used the flexbox layout to position the table of books read and the form to add a book side-by-side. The form includes the title, author, score (rating of the book 1-5), notes about the book, and the year the book was finished.

## Design Achievements
(Grasso)
The user had problems with my table not updating
They said that my form is very clear and obvious what to fill in for each input
I would change the way the table updates so when the submit button is clicked the new element is visible in the table

(Jaeger)
The user had issues with elements duplicating when adding a new element and not having modify/delete buttons and the webpage was not very aesthetically pleasing.
When I fixed the add element function they said the table updates correctly and the webpage is very clear
I would change the modify/delete functions when I make them functional and the layout of the webpage
