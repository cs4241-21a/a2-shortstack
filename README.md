## HW Tracker

https://a2-msacristanbenjet.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
My website allows you to record all the HW a student has to do, edit and delete assigments. It will calculate the hours of hw you have to do and how many days you have left to do each assigment.
I used a grid layout, used various selectors, and used Kaisei Decol font from google fonts.

What problems did the user have with your design?
  -	Entering today’s date gave him a -1 instead of 0 for days left. This is because it will round to the nearest integer.

What comments did they make that surprised you?
  -	He idn’t expect the edit button to be opposite site of delete button, but worked nicely, still. I thought putting the edit and delete buttons in the locations they were was most intuative but I guess not.

Other comments:
  -	Good UI / Visual Design
  -	Date entry felt very foolproof
  -	Liked that there was an error message if not all fields were full.

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
   - relocate the edit button to the other side
   
   - for days left field, I would change it to days:hours:min left
