## Library Wayback machine

So my project is a book recording system where a user enters the book name, author, ID# and the # of weeks it will be checked out.
in the database it calculates the return date of the book assuming that the user checks it out right at the moment it is entered into the system. 
All the fields must be filled or else the table shows improper data. The required tag in the input HTML tag does not seem to work anymore or else this problem would have been solved. 


## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used the required tag to make sure my forms have non-null inputs, but the tag itself doesn't do this after the first test for some reason. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: None
