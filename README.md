## CS4241 Assignment #2: High Score Leaderboard

https://a2-bplima.glitch.me/

For this project, I wanted to create a high score leaderboard that would be applicable to any game. I tried using a form to collect the data from the user and display it in the leaderboard below.

CSS Positioning Techniques:
Used a grid display in order to successfully center my layout
Used a section for my form so it can have it's own unique styling

Instructions:

1. Enter your username
2. Enter your high score
3. Hit submit and your score will display in the leaderboard

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: The website has a single page that contains a single form. When the user submits the form with a proper username and high score greater than 0, the leaderboard below will populate. There are two fields where the user can enter data and it is stored in the table under the fields.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: Testing

Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

What problems did the user have with your design?
The leaderboard would not populate whenever the user completed the fields and hit the submit button.

What comments did they make that surprised you?
The user suggested I add more text to add more to the website. Even though the instructions are simple, the user found the website plain.

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
I would ensure that the submit button is properly populating the leaderboard table. I would also try to pick a better color scheme and add some more designs around the webpage.

#### Challenges

- I struggled for a while trying to figure out how to get the submission button to get the proper data to display in the below leaderboard.
