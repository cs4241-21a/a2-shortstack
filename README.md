## League of Legends Team Sign up
My Application is a simple sign up form that displays the current sign-ups on the website. I used a flexbox to structure my data table. 
In order to use my application, you simple fill out the information in the form and click submit, and it will update the sign-up form. The server determines if you are guaranteed to make a team
by doing some simple calculations based on the number of sign-ups (if the number is a multiple of 5, everyone is eligible to be on a team)
However you cannot edit or delete prior responses nor does it detect duplicate responses. 
Some features I would like to have implemented are: 
editing/deleting responses 
flagging duplicate reseponses 
properly analyzing the players rank and position data to generate teams 
potentially use the summoner name input to pull user information from Riot's API

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
My page always shows the server-side data in the sign-ups list below the form. It was difficult for me to implement because I struggled 
with understanding how to receive a response from the server, and then I was struggling with having it display on my HTML page. 
## Design Achivements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1. Last name: Goon 
2. User was surprised by fields showing as editable but not actually saving and that there was previous information on the server that did not initialize. Made off handed comment about the data table not having border. 
3. There were no surprising comments
4. I would have it update the server on initial load and have it actually allow the user to edit and save their edits
