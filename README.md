Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

Your application is required to implement the following functionalities:

- a `Form/Entry` functionality which allows a user to add, modify, or delete data items residing in the server's memory
- All pages should [validate](https://validator.w3.org)

1. Fork the starting project code (make sure to fork the 2021 repo!). This repo contains some starter code that may be used or discarded as needed.
2. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
4. Deploy your project to Glitch, and fill in the appropriate fields in your package.json file.
5. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a2-yourGithubUsername` so we can find it.
6. Modify the README to the specifications below, and delete all of the instructions originally found in this README.
7. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Label the pull request as follows: a2-gitusername-firstname-lastname

*Technical*
- (10 points) Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

*Design/UX*
- (5 points per person, with a max of 10 points) Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task for them to complete (ideally something short that takes <10 minutes), and then use the [think-aloud protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol) to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also find). Important considerations when designing your study:

1. Make sure you start the study by clearly stating the task that you expect your user to accomplish.
2. You shouldn't provide any verbal instructions on how to use your interface / accomplish the task you give them. Make sure that your interface is clear enough that users can figure it out without any instruction, or provide text instructions from within the interface itself. 
3. If users get stuck to the point where they give up, you can then provde instruction so that the study can continue, but make sure to discuss this in your README. You won't lose any points for this... all feedback is good feedback!

You'll need to use sometype of collaborative software that will enable you both to see the test subject's screen and listen to their voice as they describe their thoughts. After completing each study, briefly (one to two sentences for each question) address the following in your README:

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

*You do not need to actually make changes based on their feedback*. This acheivement is designed to help gain experience testing user interfaces. If you run two user studies, you should answer two sets of questions.
