### Are You Pog?: The Survey
For this assignment, I created a survey that determines the user's "pog" level based on their age and favorite color (to attain the level of "A bit", they must be between age 15 and 40, inclusive; to attain the level of "Yes", they must have a favorite color that is not brown, orange, yellow, blue, or red). Entries are automatically added to the results table below the form. The table is formatted with flex formatting to ensure maximum visual appeal.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The app uses a single page with a form for data submission and constantly updates the cumulative submissions. These submissions can also be deleted, which is automatically updated in the server side as well.
