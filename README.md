Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Due: September 12th 
Prof Charlie gave me a pushed back due date so I could go to office hours and better understand what the code did to complete the project. Unfortunately even after office hours and asking both my uncle and a classmate for help, I still can't seem to get the code to reach the handlePost function (my friend that I asked couldn't either). I still made the functionality for a table if it did get to the handle post though.


## Your Web Application Title
Post COVID Pizza Party Planner (PCPPP) is spposed to give you how many of each size pizza you should get based on how many people are coming to your party. CSS Flexbox Layout was used to position the site. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The funtionality for a table to load when data is submitted is coded, though the data is not being pushed to the server (unknown why it is not working). There are inputs on the screen. The table does add space when you click submit as if it is adding something, but nothing comes through.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
    Objective: find out how many pizzas you need for 20 non-gf people who want 1 slice each.
    1. Caira 
    2. None with submitting but they can't see the pizzas she needs because of my server problem.
    3. There's a lot of writing, but it's mostly useful.
    4. I would take some of the text out and, if I wanted it to be more modern, change the color scheme as well as some of the pictures I have on the site. I would also add some CSS to the table to make it look better.

-Flexbox Layout is used to change the layout of the screen depending on width, therefore the site sizes with the screen.

-Input fields change appearance when clicked so you know which one you are typing in. 

-I use divs for all parts of my site and use flexbox to size and move them. Each div also uses flexbox for items inside of it making the page very customizable and helping with resizing based on screen width.
