## Movie Watchlist
https://a2-praisex.glitch.me
My web application can be used to add a movie to a watchlist. In order to you use it all you have to do is fill out the fields(title, director, genre, year released), check the box if it's currently showing in theaters or not and click the submit button. The derived field checks if the movie came out this year and if it's still in theaters. If it is in theaters and the year it came out is not equal to the current year, it will say it is leaving theaters soon. Otherwise it will say it is not Leaving theaters soon. I used a CSS flexbox for the form, and a CSS table to store the entries.
