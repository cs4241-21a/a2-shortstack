## Colorful Communicator
This project provides a system for customizing the color of the message box for messages posted to a bullitin board. 
The flexbox positioning technique was used to layout each of the messages

The project is quite self-explanatory:
1. Write your name
2. Choose a color
3. Write your message
4. Click send!

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Used JS to create new message elements on the page. An order property of -1 for the header keeps it at the top
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Enabled multi-user communication (via refresh) in bulletin-board style. Each client receives all messages sent and stored (temporarily) on the server from any other client (Form for users to submit data and displays the current state of the server-side data)

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Conducted 1 user study:
  1. **Last name of tester:** Lee
  2. **Problems encountered:** user double-clicked to try and clear placeholder text. User tried to send message with enter key
  3. **Comments made:** User was surprised at font choice
  4. **Changes based on feedback:** I would make the form submit when the enter key was pressed. I would also find a better way to signify that the placeholder text was placeholder. I would consider changing the font
