To modify a task, click the "Edit" button to the right of the entry in the table, edit the highlighted fields, and click the "Submit" button (replaces the "Edit" button) to complete the edit. Alternatively, you can click the "Cancel" button (replaces the "Delete" button) to cancel the edit.<br>
To delete a task, click the "Delete" button to the right of the entry in the table.
