A friend of mine collects bread clips, aka "occlupanids". This is a whole area of study, under the Holotypic Occlupanid Research Group. (Give it a google.) This is a tool that could be used to log one's collection and sort them by family, acquisition date, and identifying features.

This project has a submit (add) button and delete (x) buttons for each individual entry. On submitting or deleting, the collection (which is sorted by date, descending) updates, as well as a graph at the top which shows the breakdown of specimens by family. The graph involves color bars specifically designed to be [colorblind-friendly](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind), and displays the name and percentage on mouseover.
