## A2-shortstack - Who was more responsible for the patriots dynasty?
Beb Robinson - https://a2-bennyrob.glitch.me/

For my application, I decided to create a form which asks the user who is most responsible for the patriots dynasty. 

I took a unique approach to this. For some reason I couldn't override the default form submit function, so I decided to use the built in one and send the data through the URL

**Instructions**

Fill out the form, enter your name and hit submit. Make sure you select the radio buttons you want.

**Baseline requirements:**

Has a server with a dataset consisting of 4 fields

Has a results functionality which displays the data (Bottom of the screen)

Has an add functionality which adds data from a form

Has server logic and a derived field, the "Is a Patriots fan" is "Yes" if someone chose equal and that they watch football. Any other combination is a "No"

**HTML**

Uses HTML forms and table

**CSS**

Has styling, multiple kinds of selectors and uses flexbox

**Javascript**

Has javascript for fetching data from the server. Data is sent to the server through the default form submit

**Node.js**

Has a working HTTP server



## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My website has a form you can fill out and it is automatically updated everytime you submit a form or refresh the page.
If you hit submit on the form you will see the data update.
