### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
    - Tester: Xizhao Zhang (out of class)
    - problems: He think he is unlucky to get a powerful enough servant in random roll.
    - He think it's interesting to play with this app. It gives him a feeling of drawing card.
    - At first, he think the page is not clear, so I use grid to seperate it.

    - problems: no problems
    - He said it's good enough to be submitted
