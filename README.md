## Your Web Application Title
Netlfix, Disney+, Discovery+ and plus everything else! is the title of my web application. The premise of the app is to log the various movies and shows that are offered on the multitude of streaming platforms available today. You can type in the streaming service you are using, if you are currently subscribed, the name of film/title, if you would ever watch it again, and a number rating from 1-10. You cannot stream from this site but it should be helpful keeping track of all your shows and movies that you have watched since the platforming of streaming content online became much more mainstream than watching re-runs and releases on television. It might even help you save money by noticing what streaming services you do not utilize often.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of...
- (10 points) Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

I tried my best to complete the project as outlined, I ran into difficulties with the server returning the data I had inputted. I could get it working for labels but not forms, I had a tough time trying to get this to work. Usually I am not this stubborn when it comes to reaching out for assistance but I wanted to complete the task, next time I will begin reaching out as early as possible. My planned technical achievement was taking into account the answers of: if the user watched the movie/show again and if they had given a high valued rating (7-10). I was able to implement the watched again method but functionality was not there as the server failed to update the page. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Evaluation 1: Robinson
2. They understood that some functionality was not there but thoroughly enjoyed the ability to record the shows on various streaming platforms they have subscribed to.  
3. It also caused them to remember shows on platforms they are currently not subscribed to and have given thoughts about making additional payments to see that content once again. I would not have guessed for this to have a financial impact on them to resubscribe to streaming platforms that they had discontinued.
4. I would like to show their inputs displaying accordingly.

Evaluation 2: Caira
2. They did not like how big the Star Wars picture was, they know I am a big fan of Star Wars and they get sick of me mentioning it all the time. They did appreciate the idea of recording streamed shows and movies into one localized area for viewing. 
3. She mentioned that it would be a cool idea to develop an app that would handle my idea into one much more fleshed out. She said you could even have the other streaming services offer dual login to record watched shows on this app and compare streaming services and the competing market to what kinds of content is readily available. 
4. I would add pictures of movies/shows that are much smaller and stagnant on the page. By including a breakdown of content appreciated of a specified generation I could see more traffic on the page should it ever reach that stage.
