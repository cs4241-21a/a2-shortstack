## Homework Tracker!
Victoria Grasso: https://a2-vygrasso.glitch.me/

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by displaying user input that is sent to the server. It is a "Homework Tracker" application that adds the homework people are assigned to the display. As displayed on the website, to use the application users can type in the class and assignment they want to keep track of, select the drop down for whether or not the assignment is complete, select the due date, and click the submit button. Note: If they do not select a due date, the website will not be able to calculate the days left.
For CSS positioning I used a flexbox and styled the page using element, id, and class selectors and changed the background color, font, and padding of the table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: User Study
1. Gagnon
2. She thought the table could have been centered better.
3. She liked the background color.
4. I would attempt to center the divs better in the flexbox and adjust the spacing between them.
- **Design Achievement 2**: User Study
1. McEnaney (outside of class)
2. She wanted to modify the entries to change something from not completed to completed.
3. She also liked the background color.
4. I would add/fix the modify and delete functions to change entries in the table.
