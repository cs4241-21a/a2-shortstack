Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
My website allows you to record all the HW a student has to do, edit and delete assigments. It will calculate the hours of hw you have to do and how many days you have left to do each assigment.
I used a grid layout, used various selectors, and used Kaisei Decol font from google fonts.
