## Project Name: a2-mfrossetti

The project takes the input of a name, age, and type of vehicle license and determines whether or not they are a legal driver. The requirements are that one must have a name and be over 16 with a drivers
permit or at least 18 with a drivers license to be considered a legal driver. The data is returned to div elements as part of a grid that can list out multiple "drivers" at once. The grid contains labels in
the first elements to indicate the fields below them.

The project can be reached at https://a2-mfrossetti.glitch.me


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The user submits the form with the 3 fields of information to the server. The server then calculates if the information correlates to a legal driver and returns a value of "Yes" or
"No". This value, along with all the other values from the form are appended to the grid element at the top of the screen so that the user is able to see all information submitted along with the result of
their eligibility to drive.
