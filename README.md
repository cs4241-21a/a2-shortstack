## A simple todo list app

This project is a simple todo prioritizing app. It can take todos, the day they need to be done, and their perceived difficulty, and display them in a table of the week. An extra field assumes certain multipliers for given days of the week and includes adjusted difficulties for each todo item.

In the CSS, each of the types of tags are either centered, have their fonts altered or both. The background color for the entire page was changed as well.

The website is hosted at https://broadleaf-insidious-mollusk.glitch.me

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
My web app is able to show all data a user has previously submitted on a single page and updates those results when new ones are available. The derived field remains just as up to date as the non dervived components.

The table is organized so that each row is created dynamically with multiple user inputs.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 

From my two think alouds, I discovered

McKeen: 
1. The use of multipliers for the adjusted difficulty were unclear
2. The interface as a whole felt pretty solid
3. The spacing on the table could use some changes to make it more readable

Austin(outside of class):
1. The boxes in the table needed to be more readable
2. The bullets and fonts were cool
3. Make the table easier to read
