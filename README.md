## <a href="https://a2-aburke921.glitch.me/">Tip Calculator</a>
The idea of this web application is if a group (or single person) goes out to dinner and needs to divide the bill evenly amongst it's group members. The user may give in the webpage, the number of people that the bill should be divided by, the total amount due for the bill and the amount of money they would like to give as a tip. Once the user gives the amount due, some auto generated tip values are shown to make it easy for the user to determine what type of tip they should give. After the user hits the calculate button, the form will be submitted and a saved version will show up beneath the original form. The user has the ability to edit this form where they can either delete it entirely or edit the values they originally gave.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The webpage always show the current state of the server-side data. This is done by creating additional "tip receipts" that list at at the bottom of the form.
- **User can edit server data**: The user can edit any submitted form which will then also update the values in the server. 
- **User can delete data**: Additionally if the user goes into edit mode and then clicks the delete button in the upper right hand corner of the form, the form will delete from the screen and the data will delete from the server. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: After giving Stephano Jordhani the chance to work with my webpage, I learnt that it was not as clear on how to use as I thought it was. Stephano thought that at the very beginning he was supposed to do something with the auto generated tips and give it a value. While this surprised me, I guess it did make some sense since. After receiving his feedback, I changed the webpage so that when the user hovers over the auto generated tips, their cursor becomes "not allowed" indicating they don't need to do anything.

- **Design Achievement 1**: I also received feedback about my webpage from Yihong Xu. Yihong. The only negative feedback Yihong had after using my webpage was to make the input field required to be filled out in order to hit the calculated/submit button. I was also not surprised by this and would have liked to fix this if there was more time with the assignment. This however can be fixed by disabling the button until both the amount due and the tip is given.
