## League of Legends Team Sign up
My Application is a simple sign up form that displays the current sign-ups on the website. I used a flexbox to structure my data table. 
In order to use my application, you simple fill out the information in the form and click submit, and it will update the sign-up form. The server determines if you are guaranteed to make a team
by doing some simple calculations based on the number of sign-ups (if the number is a multiple of 5, everyone is eligible to be on a team)
However you cannot edit or delete prior responses nor does it detect duplicate responses. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
My page always shows the server-side data in the sign-ups list below the form. It was difficult for me to implement because I struggled 
with understanding how to receive a response from the server, and then I was struggling with having it display on my HTML page.
