## WPI Course Organizer
My application allows users to store the names, codes, professors, and grades for any class they have attended at WPI.  The user must fill out each field with the necessary information before submitting a new course.  The 'Department' field is a calculated field, its value is taken by accessing the letters present in the course code and matching them to a department with a switch statement.  The page was formatted using the 'grid' functionality.  The application also calculates the student's GPA based on their grades, which can either be an A (4.0), a B (3.0), or a C (2.0), any other value defaults to a GPA contribution of 1.0. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of CSS, JS, and HTML, I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.  Any data that the user adds to the dataset can be immediately seen on the page, and the GPA calculation is adjusted automatically as well.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Using a combination of CSS, JS, and HTML, I added a graphical element that displays the calculated GPA.  The graphic responds to data being added in real time and adds a new layer of functionality to the program; rather than just being a way to keep previous classes, teachers, and grades organized, it also acts as a GPA calculator.
