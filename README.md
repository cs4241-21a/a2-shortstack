## Password Holder
For this project, I made a password holder website. This website allows a user to input values for a username and password for a website, and it holds onto them so they don't forget! It also lets you know how strong your password is while doing so!

For this project I used the CSS grid layout. I ensured to used selectors for classes, ids, and more. I added a color scheme and other bits of flair to make the site more appealing.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I made the website into a single page app, when the user inputs a piece of data, it gets processed by the server. The server holds onto all data given by the user, and sends it all back for the client to update on their display, thus they can see all entered passwords, with a derived critique of every password.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Mayank Govilla and I did a mutual discussion of our website. I let him use and see mine, listened to his thoughts, and responded to his critiques. In terms of functionality, he did not have too much to say. He thought it was a funny concept for a website, he suggested maybe blurring out the passwords that are displayed. He also added a critique which I did end up fixing. My blurb at the top of the site spanned the width of the whole browser, which looked a tad weird. I adjusted it afterward to have a maximum width. It surprised me how much fun it was to discuss these very small details.
