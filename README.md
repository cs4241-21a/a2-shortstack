## Flight Reminder

This single-paged application can help users to record their flight information. Users are allowed to put in their flight information, including flight number, departure airport, arrival airport and the date. The app can automatically selected the past travel and the upcoming travel based on the date users chose or as time passed.

- I implemented the Element selectors, ID selectors, and class selectors for CSS file.
- `tr:hover` allows users to see the highlighted row in grey color, which helps them to focus on the specific row
- using external google fonts
- allows users to interact with buttons
- `flex-flow` for layout

## Technical achievenments

1. Using express for framework.
2. The app supports add data and delete data.
3. When selecting the date, the app will automatically seperate them into upcoming or past travels. Or exist upcoming travel will drop to the past travel based on the real world time.
4. Form input validation on all information, required to input.
5. Add instruction for placeholder.

## Design Achievenment

1. Shi and Zhao
2. User cannot modify the existed data, and the UI design is not fancy enough.
3. I am surprised wil Zhao's comment that he likes the highlighted row idea.
4. Try to accomplish more interactions with users and make the UI more fancier.

##### Shi "Add New Flight Task"
