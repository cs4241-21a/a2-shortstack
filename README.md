## Find My Tupps

Find My Tupps is a tupperware tracker that takes in a users input and stores it in a table on the server to access at a later point. It also returns a
probabilty that you'll get your tupperware back based on elpased date and reliablity of your friend. The page for filling out fields is set up as a tri-column view that uses a flex display for the rows to size them in CSS. For the table view, it is a traditional table implementation via CSS which also allows hover-states (as do the buttons) that change color and the row additions change based on the number of rows there is in the table.

## Technical Achievements

there is a table function that would work if this appended correctly and it doesn't and margaret and i sat for an hour
trying to find out why and no luck so i am sorry in advance that this only kind of works but the code should be sounds i tested it when i manually passed in the values to test

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:

For my first tester, I used L.Fernandes since he was next to me. I assigned him the task of adding a tupperware.
He told me that the problem he had with my design was font size and thickness, since he thinks it's narrow from a distance and blends in together. In terms of changes, I would work on this for the interface and probally run it through acessibilty testing to make sure everything checks out. For comments that surpised me, L. said that he actually enjoyed find my tups, which I did not since it caused many a headaches. He didnt get suck completing the task.

My second tester was A. Heline since he was next to me later in the week. I gave her the same task of addding a tupperware. She thought that the idea was dumb but my website was ok so it's ok. She did say that having dyanmic sizing of the website would be nice, or a button fixed on the page when you scroll to submit because everything is spread out a bit so the view feels clunky. I think that is a valid concern and I thought so too.
