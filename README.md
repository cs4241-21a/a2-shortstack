## Assignment Reminder

This webpage allow students to input their classes and class assignment no matter homeworks or projects. By putting all assignments together can help student easily find out which homework that are not finished.
For this assignment, I use CSS flexbox for layout, and use Roboto which is from google fonts. I also follow the rules in the assignment instuction about using various selector.
In order to save the data, I use SQLite3 database to store the content, and an HTML form to submit the content.
- To save data, user can input Class Name, Assignment Type, and Description about the assignment.
- After filling out the information, user can click Submit.
- After you click the submit button. To read the data, user can click the Read Saved Assignment button to read previous saved assignments.
- In order to save another assignment, user can click the back button on the left corner.

- If you cannot open the page, the database might be offline. Please let me know and i'll reboost it real quick.
