## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Data deletion and modification

By submitting a document with the same title as an existing document, its text will be modified. 

Every document has a button to delete it.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Always show up to date data

When the user adds, modifies, or deletes a document, the data on the page will be updated to reflect these changes.

- **Tech Achievement 3**: Word highlighting

The derived field of the data is a basic word -> position index. The frontend goes through the text using these indexes to surround every word with a span. When you mouse over one of these spans, it highlights as well as highlights all the other spans in the document for that same word. It also updates the word frequency area with the data for that word.
