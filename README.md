The CSS positioning techniques that were used were the section and grid layouts. 

The instructions to perform any tasks are listed on the webpage and as follows:
1. To add a task, fill in all three fields and submit.
2. To modify a task, type in the existing task name and change the priority or due date.
3. To delete a task, type in the exisitng task name and leave all other fields blank.
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 

This applications runs on one, single page which can continuously update when user enters information in the fields. 
Provides a form for user to submit data. There are three functionalities: adding, modifying, and deleting that the user has total control of the data entered on the server side. 
The remaining days data field is a derived field as well. This applications has four data fields where the first three are entered by the user and the remaining days field is a derived field calculated by the server based on the due date subtracted from the current date. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 

1. Last Name: Grasso
2. The user didn't know what options to put for the priority field. I addressed that problem by adding high/medium/low options in the textbox. 
3. One thing that surprised me was the user was able to delete a task with no problem as I thought my instruction could have been misinterpreted. 
4. I would change the priority field to a dropdown bar or something more clear than a text field.
