## Work Database
Steven Tran https://a2-stevenptran.glitch.me

Hello! This is basically a work database that determines if a person is a part time or full time employee of the company.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: This is a single page app that provides both a form (at the top) and a table that responds and sends back and updates the data to the client (below the form)
- **Note about delete**: The delete button is functional, but it will delete the first row (including the header) regardless of which button is pressed. Also when you reload the page, the preset values will appear. You can press this for fun, but when checking if the data stays after refreshing, don't press this button!

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1. Andrew Kerekon
    -Problems with design: Layout is very nice, but delete button doesn't function as expected and refresh seems to bring back old values.
    -Comments that surprised me: The 'do not click' button leads to sonmething wildly unexpected!
    -Changes based on feedback: I would work to fix the delete button.
2. Michael Zeolla
    -Problems with design: The delete button doesn't function properly.
    -Comments that surprised me: People over 18 could be a college student.
    -Changes based on feedback: I would change the delete function and possible ask a yes/no question on if they're in school.
