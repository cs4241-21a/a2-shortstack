## BMI Calculator
My project is a simple BMI calculator that takes a user's name, height (in feet and inches) and weight(in pounds) and uses a formula to calculate BMI in the English system. After a user clicks submit, the data is sent to the server and then posted to both the webpage at the bottom in a results table, and in the developer console, and their BMI is posted above as a result. Their weight status is also derived from their BMI and put into the results table. The user can then add more data in the same way, or they can edit and delete data using the edit(and then clicking save where the edit button is to save changes) and delete buttons created for each entry in the results table. I used a grid for the calculator, which arranges the textboxes, button and image nicely. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Other than allowing the client to add data to the server, the client can also edit and delete data using the edit(then clicking save where the edit button is after entering the new data) and delete buttons in the table of results. They were difficult because I had to understand which functions to use, and especially with the edit, I had to find a way to display the editing field's data in the textboxes and have the button save the data and change it in the results table.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: I created a single page app that always shows the state of the server's data in the developer console. This took me time because I had to reconfigure my code to make sure that the data was arranged correctly in the array of data so that fields could be selected. To show the server's data after the user made an edit was especially hard because it took me time to figure out that to fetch data the keyword data had to be used to access fields, and then to update each field to its new value took me time.
