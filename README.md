## Grocery List Simulator

My web application can be used to input grocery items, their brand and unit prices to create a grocery list.
The derived field calculates the total price for a specific grocery item by multiplying the quantity and the unit price.
In order to use the application, you have to fill out the form and hit enter.
I used a CSS table for the form, and a CSS flexbox for the inputted data.
