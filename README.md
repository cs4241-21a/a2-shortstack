## To-Do List
My website is a simple to-do list where you can add tasks, the date it's due and the time it's due. Depending on the deadline, the site will indicate how urgent the task is using exclamation marks. You are also able to edit and delete the tasks, as well as them as complete.

## Technical Achievements
- **Add/Edit/Delete Tasks**: Users are able to add new tasks onto the list and have it be updated on the client side. In addition, they can edit and delete the data and the server sends back the updated info.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **UI Review (Reviewed by Lin)**: She enjoyed the cute and simple design. For improvements, she would like to see the list items reorder itself based on how urgent it is. In addition to that, the date and time inputs differed from my browser and hers. Each item in the to-do list had a small x button next to the time and date input on hers, whereas mine did not. Because of this, the x button did not do anything until she clicked the edit button, which was confusing for her.
- **UI Review (Reviewed by McFatter)**: He enjoyed the color scheme and style of the UI. A suggestion he made was to a label for the date and time inputs. At first glance it was not very clear how to use it.
