Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Glitch is not working for me for this project so I captured a video of me using the local site (there were no errors in my repository in vs code or anything). It is attached in the repo. It is called a2-katesincaglia-video.zip.

## Social Media Username Generator
Ever have trouble coming up with a username for your social media? Well this page is here to help! The form takes the user's name and outputs a fun, unique username! I made the background color a nice appealing light pink, and used the Lato font for the whole page (sourced from Google Fonts). These was applied using CSS to the whole body. I also added an image of social media company logos. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single page site that takes in the user inputed data, takes it to the server, then the program ourputs the updated piece of data in real time for the user to see. Then the user can input the data again for another result.
