## Simple Scoreboard
[https://a2-jmeggitt.glitch.me](https://a2-jmeggitt.glitch.me)

I implemented a very simple scoreboard. Anyone can add a score in the "Add Score" section and it will get displayed
below to anyone who loads the page. For my derived field, I have the date which updates whenever a line is added or
changed. The ranking column is computed on the client side. With the edit button you can modify the name and sore for
any row. Changes are sent to the remote when the save button is pressed.

For the graphics, I used [coolors.co](coolors.co) to generate the color scheme for the table and buttons. The page uses
a flex box for the layout of elements. The font I decided to use is the Open Sans font from Google Fonts.
