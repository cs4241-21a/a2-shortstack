## Locations to Travel to
The site is list of locations you want to travel to with cost, the price of traveling there, and priority, 
how much you want to go there, and the server derives the rating of that location based on the cost and priority. 
The locations inputed in by the form through the submit button at the bottom of the page stores the data in the server which updates
table. Any changes you make to a row will be updated once the update button for that row is pressed, all other changes will be reset.
The page uses the flex position technique to center everything and align the table header with the location entries.
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The page provides a form for the user to input data to the server and always shows the current data in the server.
The data can be both updated and deleted through the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1. Goon
2. He ried to editing the rating which can't be edited since its the derived field.
3. I was suprised that not clarifying that high value for priority meant higher priority was abit confusing.
4. The changes I would make is the clarify the priority level and changing the rating column to make it look like it can't be edited.
