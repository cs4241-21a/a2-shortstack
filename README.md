## Your Web Application Title
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

This is a shopping list I created. Urgent items have a deadline one day from today. Not urgent items have a deadline of 1 week. 
For css, I mainly used CSS grid. The instructions are at the top and I think the app is easy to use. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
Created a single page app. It always shows you the current state of the data on the server. Loading the page at start has an empty list because the user didnt add any items yet. Any time the user submits the form, the server responds with the updated data including the derived fields. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 

- Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
  - Eteng
- What problems did the user have with your design?
  - He accidentally added two items of the same name. He got frustrated that the rows didn't merge
- What comments did they make that surprised you?
  - I was surprised that he thought the colors were distracting
- What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
  - I would add functionality that checks if the item already exists in the data and if it does, add the count to that json. I shouldn't make a brand new row in the table for it.
