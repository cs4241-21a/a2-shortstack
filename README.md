This project focuses on the communication between the client and the server as the user enters in the required fields and the website will display data that is on the server side. After inputting and displaying the data, the user can either submit more data, edit a row, or delete a row from the table. Upon selecting an option from the selector box, the derived field, advice, will show depending on the user's selection.

Technical Achievement:

1. Displays the data the user inputted in a new row in the table as it displays the current data that the server holds and allows the user to add, edit, or remove a row. Console will display what is currently in the server as it responds to the user's input.

Design Achievements:

1. Added a feature to the text fields of the website where there is no autocompletion when the user inputs text in the text field.
2. Added a feature when the user clicks on either text field or the selector box, it automatically clears the text that was present.
3. Added alerts for when the user inputs empty fields or just submitting the fields that are not valid (text being only one letter or entering preexisting fields: "Enter you name here"/"Enter your major here").
4. Applied two Google fonts for the text and added a hover feature when a user hovers over a text field, select box, or a button the color changes.
