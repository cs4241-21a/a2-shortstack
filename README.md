This project is a Tetris game that saves the players scores similar to scoreboards in arcades.

Achivements:

## Technical

1. Displays names and scores of the players played before on the scoreboard
2. Displays the name and the score of the current player
3. Updates the scoreboard after the game is over
4. Derrives the attempt number based on how many same players are already on the board

## Design

1. Tetris Game: People Come Here To Play Tetris :)
2. The form is self explanatory but added instructions for the game controls
3. The website was reviewed:

   - Ivan Martinovic
   - Too Small of the game screen is the only problem
   - N/A
   - I would make the canvas bigger, but then I would have to calculate the scale again :)
