This is an application that receives names and orders from people who are a certain distance from a restaurant and will
calculate the estimated time the order will be dropped off to the user based on this distance. I used flex for my CSS positioning
technique which is the class I used to store my table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit data
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Created checks and alerts that make sure the user doesn't leave any fields empty
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Implemented a delete button that allows users to delete entries

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
  1. Last name Ayvazian
  2. Felt like I could include AM or PM for the times
  3. I was surprised that I hadn't thought to include AM or PM
  4. I would probably add a feature that tracks whether the order was placed in the morning or afternoon
