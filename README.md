## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data, as the data constantly is outputed as it is saved to the server. The display is then continuously updated with each input.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with. Stusalitus
2. What problems did the user have with your design? Really crammed text in my table, the coloring was not pleasing
3. What comments did they make that surprised you? They liked the font and spacing of the data that was relayed back to the user, and the derived data had differantiating comments.
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback? I would space out my text more and choose better colors. Maybe consult an artist about my website color and design.

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with. Ropi (This was my brother, not sure if this is allowed but i dont know anyone else in the class)
2. What problems did the user have with your design? He used a mobile device and some of the text was getting jumbled up together
3. What comments did they make that surprised you? He said it was impossible to accomplish my task, due to the inabillity to read the content on the screen
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback? I had to move some things around just to adjust for the drastic change when using a mobile device. In the future I should focus on compatibility more, so more people can have access to the content.
