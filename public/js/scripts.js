// Add some Javascript code here, to run on the front end.

/*
    here's the rundown:
        let people input stuff
        when they try to submit, make sure it's all there, and all accurate data (no negative ages)
        if the conditions are met,
            post it to the server
            update the visuals on the client side
            clear the fields
        if not, don't

    required functionality:
        [C]    the server file having an appdata array for JSON purposes, where data is kept 
        [C]    a Results() function(ality) that shows the entire data set (display the entirety of appdata in the console or something similar)
        [C]    a working Form via which users can add stuff to appdata, with a minimum of 3 fields to be entered
        [C]    server logic which will generate a derived field upon receiving data
        [C]        adds this to the appdata array, is not user-modifiable, just exists as an aspect of the data
        [C]        Must be based on the existing and supplied fields for data
