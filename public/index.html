        <p id="helpText">Welcome to Blackjack! The goal is to get as close to a card total of 21 points without going over.
          To start, press the Start Game button. Then, you must input however much money you want to bet.
          Finally, you must press the Place Bet button, and the game will start. Once the game has started,
          You can see your cards and card total as well as the computer's cards and card total.
          You can choose to either draw a card or hold your cards. Drawing a card will force both you and the computer.
          to draw a card. Holding your cards will cause you to stop playing and the computer to draw one more card.
          If you or the computer reach exactly 21 points, that player will instantly win.
          If you or the computer reach over 21 points, that player will instantly lose.
          If you hold your cards and the computer has more points than you after it draws, then you will lose.
          If you win, you will receive twice the amount of money you bet as a reward.
          After a player has won, the game will reset.
